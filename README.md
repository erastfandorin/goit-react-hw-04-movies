You can watch today trending movies
[here](https://erastfandorin.github.io/goit-react-hw-04-movies/#/). You can
share a link to your favorite movie with a friend(`react-router-dom`). Loading
the main page is faster, thanks to the breakdown of the bundle into
chunks(`react-lazy`).

In this project I mastered:

- React
- react-create-app
- react-router-dom
- react-lazy

All components are in the src folder. `.editorconfig`, `.eslintrc`, `.huskyrc`,
`.lintstagedrc`, `.prettierrc` - configuration files for plugins used for to
format the code and keep it clean. All another files was generated by
`react-create-app`.

You can run this project locally just do:

1. clone branch `master` with
   `git clone https://github.com/erastfandorin/goit-react-hw-04-movies` or fork
   it and then clone it from your forked repo
1. `cd goit-react-hw-04-movies`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
